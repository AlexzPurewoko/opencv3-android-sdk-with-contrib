# OpenCV 3.3.1 Android SDK with contrib modules

The official build doesn't provide contrib modules.

## Download

Go to `./OpenCV-android-sdk`, just like the offical SDK, all are there including contrib modules.

For someone who are curious about the generated JNI code, go to `./o4a` or other build intermediate directories.

## How to build yourself

Please refer to http://yangchao.me/post/build-opencv-android-sdk/

# Notice

To fit my own project, I just add `Aruco` as the 3rd-party module. If you want to build with other contrib modules, do it yourself or email me so that I can do it for you if you are really busy man or lazy :(
