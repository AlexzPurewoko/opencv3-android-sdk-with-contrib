# OpenCV 3.3.1 Android SDK with contrib modules

The official build doesn't provide contrib modules. This build includes all the `opencv-contrib` modules.

## Download

Go to `./OpenCV-android-sdk`, just like the offical SDK, all are there including contrib modules.

For someone who are curious about the generated JNI code, go to `./o4a` or other build intermediate directories.

## How to build yourself
